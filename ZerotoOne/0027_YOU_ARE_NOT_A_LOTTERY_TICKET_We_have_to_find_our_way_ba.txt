YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET @BRK#We have to find our way back to a definite future, and the Western world needs nothing short of a cultural revolution to do it. @BRK#Where to start? John Rawls will need to be displaced in philosophy departments. Malcolm Gladwell must be persuaded to change his theories. And pollsters have to be driven from politics. But the philosophy professors and the Gladwells of the world are set in their ways, to say nothing of our politicians. Itâ€™s extremely hard to make changes in those crowded fields, even with brains and good intentions. @BRK#A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.
