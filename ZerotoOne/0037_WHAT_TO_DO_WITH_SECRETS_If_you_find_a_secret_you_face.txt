WHAT TO DO WITH SECRETS @BRK#If you find a secret, you face a choice: Do you tell anyone? Or do you keep it to yourself? @BRK#It depends on the secret: some are more dangerous than others. As Faust tells Wagner: @BRK#The few who knew what might be learned, @BRK#Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show, @BRK#And reveal their feelings to the crowd below, @BRK#Mankind has always crucified and burned. @BRK#Unless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it’s rarely a good idea to tell everybody everything that you know. @BRK#So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there’s always a golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody—and that’s a company. The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator. @BRK#As Tolkien wrote in The Lord of the Rings: @BRK#The Road goes ever on and on @BRK#Down from the door where it began. @BRK#Life is a long journey; the road marked out by the steps of previous travelers has no end in sight. But later on in the tale, another verse appears: @BRK#Still round the corner there may wait @BRK#A new road or a secret gate, @BRK#And though we pass them by today, @BRK#Tomorrow we may come this way @BRK#And take the hidden paths that run @BRK#Towards the Moon or to the Sun. @BRK#The road doesn’t have to be infinite after all. Take the hidden paths.
